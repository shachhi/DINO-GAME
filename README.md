This is an simple dino game inspired by chrome dino. With a 2X8 bit grid a 1 bit dino and a obstacles of maximum length 2 with the distance between any 2 obstacles =3bits. Basic verilog concepts like (continuous and procedural assginments, finite state machines, linear feedback shift register etc.) are used. Used combinational logic to detect collision.
